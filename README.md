# Twitter Sentiment Analysis with Machine Learning

This project performs sentiment analysis on Twitter data using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify tweets into positive or negative sentiments based on text data.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The project leverages a large dataset of pre-processed tweets to build a machine learning model capable of predicting the sentiment of a tweet. It includes data preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF, and model training using Logistic Regression.

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle:
- **Dataset Name**: Sentiment140
- **Source**: [https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140](https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140)

The dataset contains **1.6 million tweets** with the following columns:
- `target`: Sentiment (0 = Negative, 1 = Positive)
- `id`, `date`, `flag`, `user`, `tweet_text`

## âš¡ Installation

Install required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install kaggle kagglehub nltk scikit-learn pandas numpy
````

Download the dataset from Kaggle and extract it:

```bash
kaggle datasets download -d kazanova/sentiment140

unzip sentiment140.zip
```

## ðŸ›  Preprocessing Steps

* Removed non-alphabetic characters.
* Converted text to lowercase.
* Removed stopwords using NLTK.
* Applied Porter Stemmer for stemming words.
* Transformed the tweet text into TF-IDF features.

## ðŸŽ¯ Model Training

* Logistic Regression is used as the primary classifier.
* Model is trained on preprocessed data and evaluated using accuracy score.

## ðŸ“Š Evaluation

The notebook includes performance evaluation metrics after training, such as accuracy score on the test dataset.

## ðŸ“š Usage

1. Set up your Kaggle API key (`kaggle.json`) for downloading the dataset.
2. Run preprocessing steps to clean the raw data.
3. Train the Logistic Regression model on the processed data.
4. Evaluate model performance and analyze results.

## ðŸ”§ Future Improvements

* Explore other machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
* Perform hyperparameter tuning for better performance.
* Visualize data distributions and model predictions.
